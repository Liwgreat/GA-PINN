The initial work for this paper, titled "GA-PINNs: Generative Adversarial Physics-informed Neural Networks for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problem with Small Labeled Samples," builds upon our previous research, "Revisiting PINNs: Generative Adversarial Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Point-Weighting Method," which can be accessed (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08754). In this latest submission, we have expanded our experiments to include inverse problems, leading to a revised version of our work.

Please note that the forward problems in this repository utilize PyTorch version 1.10.0, while the inverse problems are implemented using PyTorch version 1.9.0 to meet basic requirements.
