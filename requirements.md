The initial work for this paper, titled **"GA-PINNs: Generative Adversarial Physics-informed Neural Networks for Solving Forward and Inverse PDE Problems with Small Labeled Samples,"** builds upon our previous research, **"Revisiting PINNs: Generative Adversarial Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Point-Weighting Method,"** which can be accessed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08754). In this latest submission, we have expanded our experiments to include inverse problems, resulting in a revised version of our work.

Please note that the forward problems in this repository utilize **PyTorch version 1.10.0**, while the inverse problems are implemented using **PyTorch version 1.9.0** to satisfy basic requirements.

On the Code Ocean website, I recommend running the code using Jupyter. I have created two virtual environments with PyTorch versions **1.9.0** and **1.10.0**, and have configured the kernels for different code implementations accordingly. You can run the code directly or execute the files in the `plot_code` folder to generate NRMSE curves and heatmaps.
